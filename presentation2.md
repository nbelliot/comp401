# Presentation 2 - Beam Search (algorithm)
![beam_search](https://github.com/nbelliot/comp401/blob/master/presentation2/beam_search.jpg)

###### Explanation:
**Beam search** is a search algorithm based off of heuristic where, in a graph, the most promising nodes (with the best heuristic) are expanded.  Beam search is an optimization of best-first search, reducing memory requirements.  Best-first orders all partial solutions (states) by heuristic.  In beam search, the number of best partial solutions is limited by a predetermined quantity (k).  Limiting the number of explored solutions increases memory efficiency but sacrifices completeness (guarantee of solution) and optimality (guarantee of best solution).
