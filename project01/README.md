###### Explanation:
A rope is a tree-like data structure that is meant to store a large string.  When a large string is stored in a rope, the string is divided into smaller “fragment” strings and are stored at the lowest branches of the tree.  Storing a large string in this way makes storage and manipulation more efficient.

###### Documentation:
- Edit and run `driver.py` to load a rope with text.
- `rope.py` contains rope class - see for methods and comments.
- `balanced_binaryTree.py` contains tree helper class for `rope.py` - no need to see or manipulate.
